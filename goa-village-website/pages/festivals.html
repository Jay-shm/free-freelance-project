        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carnival:</strong> The Goa Carnival is one of the most famous and unique festivals in India, held every year in February or March. Introduced by the Portuguese, this four-day festival is marked by grand parades with colorful floats, energetic music, and street dancing. Panaji, Margao, Vasco, and Mapusa host the largest processions, and the celebration culminates in a feast of traditional Goan delicacies. King Momo, the central figure of the carnival, leads the festivities, spreading the message of fun and cheer.</li>
